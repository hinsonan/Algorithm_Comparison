# Algorithm_Comparison
This program will test multiple different algorithms. 

The algorithms being tested are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quicksort and Merge Sort. 

They will all be tested using arrays.

The arrays will be of sizes 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000 except for bubble sort which will only be tested for an array up to 10000
